Test cases:      

1. If you enter a long URL it should always return a short URL back.
2. If you use a TinyURL it should always navigate to the original long URL
3. Empty URL. Result should be an exception no TinyUrl returned. In UI we show the message box.
4. Simple validation of a long Url. Make sure it starts with http.
5. If you enter exciting long Url it should return already created TinyUrl, shouldn't create a new one.
6. if we put a very very long Url it should still return a TinyUrl. No limitation in size.
7. It should never create a duplicate TinyUrl. I am writing an API that will call create TinyUrl in the loop,
   like several million times, i would store created TinyUrls in the hashset. This should throw an exception if it 
   detects a duplicate.
